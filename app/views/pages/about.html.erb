<h1>About Forage</h1>
<p>The idea for forage was born from the stories of home-growers that gew food at home - and found they were rewarded with and abundance of produce. Often these people, after giving away to friends and family and consuming themselves, would still have some left ofter - which would go into compost or into the bin!</p>
<p>Forage was first conceived by Sam Peters, looking for a way to get access to this wealth of leftovers and to provide a means for people to ensure everything they harvest gets used! </p>
